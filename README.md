# 🏏 IPL Player Performance Analysis (2008 - 2024)

> An interactive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of IPL data using **Pandas**, **Plotly**, and **Seaborn** in **Jupyter Notebook**.

---

## ✨ Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the **Indian Premier League (IPL)** matches and player statistics from **2008 to 2024**, with a special focus on player performance, team stats, venues, and memorable rivalries.

Using two primary datasets: `matches.csv` and `deliveries.csv`, we've built dynamic visualizations to reveal deep insights into:

* 🏋️ Batsmen and Bowlers performance
* 🏢 Venue and city dynamics
* ⚔️ Head-to-head player rivalries
* 📊 Seasonal & team-based trends

All visualizations are powered by **Plotly** for interactivity and better storytelling.
